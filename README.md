# Project  Introduction 
The purpose of this project is to create a website to advertise and promote a new gym opening in London called “Body Fashion”, providing all the relevant informations to the user with the intentions to get many members to join and giving good content informations of the business on different aspects.
The user can also use the website to buy supplements online and to get informations on good practice of exercise.


## Description Ux design 
The project consist of 5 pages easy to navigate using the Bootstrap Navigation bar, any link of the page when clicked open in a new tab using the attribute target= "_blank" to avoid that the user leave our page when doing so.
For now the user is disallowed to use for real the Sign Up form as it is not able to record any data yet, the user can click on the button Sign Up but not action will be implemented, the same also on <Pricing.html> this is because I have not still learn how to use backend as Python.In future I will make the Sign Up form fully fucntional.

* The  <https://www.index.html>  provide empathy to the Ux attracting their attention visually with a welcome Carousel of slide images of the gym environment, the speed of this element is contol using the attribute of data interval="desire value" that let us increase or decrease the speed of each image inside the <div> Carousel, this is very helpful, I have learn this reading it on <https://www.stackoverflow.com>. 
* As user who wants general informations on this gym and to have a better idea of what this gym offer to his members, the main page <https://www.index.html> provide informations and detailed descriptions:

- **Why is important to keep in shape?**
This section knowledge the user that one of the many benefits exercising, especially in a gym is stress relief and increase concentration of norepinephrine in the brain.
Below this section the Ux is improved giving an image example of what is mention above.


* As user who wants who is interested to find out about the Personal Trainers team, their skills and specializations, I can click on <https://www.meet.html> that describes briefly each Personal Trainer skills and qualification showing also for each one a photo, this is very helpful for passionate and gym lovers that often needs to know what kind of training schedules they can expect from their trainers looking at their descriptions and qualifications online rather than have to pop inside the gym and have a chat face to face. 
* If the user wants to know what are the general or most important gym rules before even decide wether to join the membership, can click on <https://www.rules.html>, this page not only provides the general rules but gives some hints on what to do if the member is in some danger circumastainces inside the premises, and reminds that **Discrmination and anti-social behaviour are not tolerated** as by law.  
* As user that wants to know the monthly cost of the basic membership or of any other memberships or promotions available, can click on <https://www.pricing.html>, which shows in a simple way two different options to choose from and the opportunity to get a free week trial until the end of July.
In future the promotions on this page may be changed for different ones to attract more members.
* The Ux is improved providing three links on <learn-more.html> using the anchor tags <a> and an icon for each one taken from <https://fontawesome.com/start>.
- The first link is from Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercise#Health_effects> which provide to the user a very reliable source, that states all the most important benefit of training and exercising.
- The second link is from NHS <https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/10-minute-workouts/> that give precious informations to the user on how and what exercise is possible to do right now during the pandemic caused from the Covid-19 as it is safer to stay at home in the interest of everyone and of the NHS.
- The third link is the USN official website that gives the user the opportunity to buy gym supplement online to a discount prize as the gym is in patnership with this brand (it is not a real deal patnership but could be a great marketing decision as it is a very good known brand in case this site is for a real one) here the link <https://www.usn.co.uk/shop/products/> and also informs that the members can benefits of the same buying inside the gym.
The purpose of this link it is also to attract the user attention to this details and so to join the memberships showing that the business is well organized also on this aspect. This link also give the opportunity to increase the profits potential selling supplement in partnership with a brand.In future I might create another page dedicated to the supplement products, gym equipments(t-shirts,gloves,bottles etc) to buy online.
Another link that I would like to add in future would be the Google map functionality to make the gym easier to reach through the live map routes.
For now the user is not able to buy this products unless using the official USN website. 

As user that is looking to get more specific informations or would like to feel a bit more motivated to join, the <https://www.learn-more.html> provides two Youtube videos both motivational, [train like a champion from Valrocky username] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=5&v=0UEUjQ546_g&feature=emb_title) and [Training Workouts - Beginner to Advanced Training from Criticalbench username] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2U7hY_523eQ&feature=emb_title) and other informations such as what else the gym can offer to his members that not all the gym can offer, for example **help and support to indiviual with physical problems** or that need to **recover from injuries**, how the the staff team are committed and self motivated to support and provide the best training and environment inside the premises to achieve the recovery and goals of any members, a week Timetable group classes.
